10  Implement  SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym for following relational schema:

Borrower(Rollin, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status)


create database temp;
use temp;

-- Create the Borrower table with necessary constraints
CREATE TABLE borrower (
Rollin INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique Roll number (acts like a sequence)
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- Name of the borrower
DateofIssue DATE NOT NULL, -- Book issue date
NameofBook VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- Title of the borrowed book
Status ENUM('Issued', 'Returned') NOT NULL -- Book status (Issued/Returned)
);
-- Insert sample records into Borrower table
INSERT INTO borrower (Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', '2025-05-01', 'Data Structures in C', 'Issued'),
('Pooja Rani', '2025-05-03', 'Operating Systems', 'Returned'),
('Ravi Kumar', '2025-05-04', 'Database Management', 'Issued'),
('Meena Verma', '2025-05-05', 'Computer Networks', 'Returned'),
('Ankit Joshi', '2025-05-06', 'Python Programming', 'Issued');
-- Create a view showing records where books are still issued
CREATE VIEW IssuedBooks AS
SELECT
Rollin,
Name,
NameofBook,
DateofIssue
FROM
borrower
WHERE
Status = 'Issued';
-- Create index on NameofBook for quick lookup by book title
CREATE INDEX idx_BookName ON borrower(NameofBook ASC);
-- Simulate a synonym using a view (alias for full table)
CREATE VIEW borrower_synonym AS
SELECT * FROM borrower;
-- Optional: View all records using the synonym
 SELECT * FROM borrower_synonym;
-- Optional: View only currently issued books
 SELECT * FROM IssuedBooks;
