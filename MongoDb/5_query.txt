25  Design and Implement any 5 query using MongoDB
1.	Create a collection called ‘games’.
2.	Add 5 games to the database. Give each document the following properties: name, gametype, score (out of 100), achievements
3.	Write a query that returns all the games
4.	Write a query that returns the 3 highest scored games.
5.	Write a query that returns all the games that have both the ‘Game Maser’ and
the ‘Speed Demon’ achievements.

// Step 1: Create and insert 5 games into the 'games' collection
db.games.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Racing Thunder",
    gametype: "Racing",
    score: 88,
    achievements: ["Speed Demon", "Track Master"]
  },
  {
    name: "Battle Arena",
    gametype: "Action",
    score: 92,
    achievements: ["Game Master", "Sharp Shooter"]
  },
  {
    name: "Mystery Quest",
    gametype: "Adventure",
    score: 75,
    achievements: ["Explorer", "Puzzle Solver"]
  },
  {
    name: "Speed Legend",
    gametype: "Racing",
    score: 95,
    achievements: ["Speed Demon", "Game Master"]
  },
  {
    name: "Kingdom Clash",
    gametype: "Strategy",
    score: 89,
    achievements: ["Game Master", "Tactician"]
  }
]);

// Step 2: Query 1 – Return all games
db.games.find();

// Step 3: Query 2 – Return top 3 highest scored games
db.games.find().sort({ score: -1 }).limit(3);

// Step 4: Query 3 – Return games that have both 'Game Master' and 'Speed Demon' achievements
db.games.find({
  achievements: { $all: ["Game Master", "Speed Demon"] }
});
